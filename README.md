This package exposes the `cvt` function used extensively by `libstd` to
convert platform-specific syscall error codes to `std::io::Result`.

Usually syscalls use return values for errors, the conventions differ. For instance,
on Unix `0` means success on Unix but failure on Windows.

While those conventions are not always followed, they usually are and
`cvt` is there to reduce the mental bookkeeping and make it easier to handle syscall errors.

The code was mostly copied over from Rust libstd, because the function is not public.
